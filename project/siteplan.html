        <h2>Website description and purpose</h2>
        <p>This website provides information on rides and transportation in the south east of brazil. People who want to save money 
            on their trip by joining someone else who is already driving there or who want to find cheaper bus or plane tickets that are left,
            may come to this website and look for the person or the company's contact information and use our special link to buy a ticket.
        </p>

        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>A - People may want to find cheap tickets. They may want to filter by lower prices or look at only bus tikcets, or only car rides
            and etc. I will make it so that the user can filter this kind of information and have a better user experience
        </p>
        <p>
            B - The company who uses the website will want to be able to easily add or remove rides and tickets from the website. They
            probably won't have the necessary development skills to do it using HTML. I'll make it possible for them to do it dinamically in a 
            user-friendly manner.
