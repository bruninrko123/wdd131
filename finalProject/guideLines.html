        <h2>Delays Policy</h2>
        

    <h3>Easy Trips: Delays Policy</h3>
    Understanding Possible Delays
    
    At Easy Trips, we strive to provide punctual and reliable transportation services. However, unforeseen circumstances can sometimes lead to delays in bus, plane, or car rides.
    
    <h3>Factors that may cause delays:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Traffic: Heavy traffic, accidents, and road closures can significantly impact travel times, especially in urban areas.</li>
    <li>Weather: Adverse weather conditions, such as heavy rain, fog, or snow, can cause delays or even service disruptions.</li>
    <li>Mechanical Issues: Technical problems with vehicles (buses, planes, cars) may require maintenance or repairs, leading to delays.</li>
    <li>Air Traffic Control: Delays at airports due to air traffic congestion or other operational issues.</li>
    <li>Unexpected Events: Unforeseen events such as accidents, natural disasters, or security incidents can cause significant disruptions.</li>
    <li>Legal Considerations:
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <h3>Brazilian law allows for a certain degree of flexibility regarding transportation delays. Specific regulations may vary depending on the mode of transport:</h3>
    
    
    <ul>
    <li>Buses: Intercity bus companies are generally allowed a reasonable delay due to unforeseen circumstances.</li>
    <li>Planes: Airlines are subject to regulations by the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) regarding flight delays and passenger rights.</li>
    <li>Car Rides: While specific regulations may vary, delays for car rides are generally acceptable within reasonable limits.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>Easy Trips Commitment:</h3>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Transparency: We will do our best to inform passengers of any expected delays as soon as possible.</li>
    <li>Communication: We will provide regular updates on the status of delayed services.</li>
    <li>Assistance: We will assist passengers with rebooking options or alternative transportation arrangements whenever possible.</li>
